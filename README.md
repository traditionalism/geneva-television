# geneva-television

To edit it, open `geneva-television.sln` in Visual Studio (or an equivalent).

To build it, run `build.cmd`. To run it, run the following commands to make a symbolic link in your server data directory:

```dos
cd /d [PATH TO THIS RESOURCE]
mklink /d X:\cfx-server-data\resources\[local]\geneva-television dist
```

DISCLAIMER!! THIS IS ONLY SETUP TO WORK RIGHT NOW WITH FRANKLIN'S VINEWOOD SAFEHOUSE, IF YOU ATTEMPT TO USE IT ELSEWHERE, IT WILL NOT WORK. THIS'LL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

Afterwards, you can use `ensure geneva-television` in your server.cfg or server console to start the resource.

* It's just cool.
